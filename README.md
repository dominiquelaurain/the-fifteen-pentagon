# the-fifteen-pentagon

## Introduction

I make public here some of my results about the fifteen pentagon (team Mann - McLoud - Van Derau)

Team of Bothell university made a big shocking event discovering a new pentagon tiling plane.

In this github repository I put some files about interesting results from work in Sage Math Cloud.

Picture file is intended to show the set of three tiles, which is replicated in four groups to make the 12-tiles plane filler as given on wikipedia.

## Trilinear coordinates

I have some new Python coded function about trilinear coordinates.

Here I have chosen ABC triangle
